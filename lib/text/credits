                         @GCOURT OF THE NINE MOONS@n 

A Wheel of time themed mud.  Originally started as a way of practicing C
and then C++ skills, and inspired by WoTMUD and The Mirrors of the Wheel
MUD.  Eventually the code was ported to C++ and then updated to include
most of the changes and fixes from T B A M U D.  Resurected in 2019 as
a nostalgia project, and updated again.
